### **KQL Query**

```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName startswith "remote-agent-er"
| where FileName endswith ".exe"
| where ActionType in~ ("FileCreated", "FileWritten")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, FileName, FolderPath, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, ReportId
| order by Timestamp desc

------

### **ðŸ“„ What This KQL Query Does (in simple terms)**

This KQL query looks for **.exe files** that were either created or written on devices whose name starts with **"remote-agent-er"** (the VM in question). It pulls data from the **DeviceFileEvents** table in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

The query shows:
- **When the file activity happened** (Timestamp)
- **Which device it happened on** (DeviceName)
- **The file's name and location** (FileName, FolderPath)
- **What process created or wrote the file** (InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine)
- **The ReportId to trace the event in the system**
