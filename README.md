## Overview
This project simulates a real-world corporate incident where a user triggers an EDR rule in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. The rule detects suspicious behavior and automatically isolates the affected VM. We provisioned the VM in Microsoft Azure, onboarded it to Defender, and used KQL to query logs for forensic analysis. The goal was to investigate what caused the alert and understand the userâ€™s actions based on log data.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Azure** (Virtual Machine Provisioning)
- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** (Enterprise EDR)
- **Kusto Query Language** (Log retrival)


## Objective(s)
1) **Simulate a security incident involving remote code execution in a corporate environment.**
2) **Automatically isolate a compromised VM using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.**
3) **Use KQL (Kusto Query Language) to retrieve and analyze Azure logs for forensic investigation.**
4) **Identify the root cause of the alert and track user activity through log data.**
